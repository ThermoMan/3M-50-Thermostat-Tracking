This directory holds the logs, primarily generated from the Dashboard, but errors can get logged here from other areas.

This directory must be writable by your http server.

For dev/debug convenience you should three sym links (your error log location may vary)
access.log -> /var/log/apache2/access.log
error.log -> /var/log/apache2/error.log
php-errors.log -> /var/log/php-errors.log
*These files will be read only for you.
